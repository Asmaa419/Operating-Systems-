<h2>Types of Operating system:</h2>
1.Batch Operating System:-Some computer processes are very lengthy and time-consuming. To speed the same process, a job with a similar type of needs are batched together and run as a group.
<p>2.Multi-Tasking/Time-sharing Operating systems:-Time-sharing operating system enables people located at a different terminal(shell) to use a single computer system at the same time. The processor time (CPU) which is shared among multiple users is termed as time sharing.</p>
<p>3.Real time OSA:- real time operating system time interval to process and respond to inputs is very small. Examples: Military Software Systems, Space Software Systems..</p>
<p>4.Distributed Operating System:-Distributed systems use many processors located in different machines to provide very fast computation to its </p>
<p>5.Network Operating System:- Network Operating System runs on a server. It provides the capability to serve to manage data, user, groups, security, application, and other networking functions.</p>

<h2>2.advantages of operating system:</h2>
for batch systems and Timesharing systems: 1.Repeated jobs are done fast in batch systems without user interaction
<p>2.You donâ€™t need special hardware and system support to input data in batch systems.</p>
<p>3.Best for large organizations but small organizations can also benefit from it.</p>
<p>4.Batch systems can work offline so it makes less stress on processor.</p>
<p>5.Provides the advantage of quick response.</p>
